# Papollo Hospital :- Hospital Operations and Revenue Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Title

Hospital Operations & Revenue Analysis Dashboard – Papollo Hospitals

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze hospital operations, patient flow, bed utilization, disease trends, doctor performance, and revenue generation using an interactive dashboard.
This dashboard helps hospital management make data-driven decisions to improve patient care, resource planning, and profitability.

## ❓Business Problem & Key Insights


1️⃣ What is the total revenue generated by the hospital?

The hospital has generated a total bill amount of ₹190.43 million, showing strong overall revenue performance.

2️⃣ How is bed occupancy distributed across different bed types?

Private beds have the highest occupancy

General beds are moderately occupied

ICU beds have the lowest occupancy

This shows most patients prefer or are admitted to private wards.

3️⃣ Which diagnosis has the highest number of patients?

Viral Infection has the highest patient count (~200K)

Followed by Flu and Malaria

Fracture cases are the lowest

This helps identify the most common health issues treated by the hospital.

4️⃣ How many patients are treated under each major disease category?

Viral Infection: ~200K

Flu: ~172K

Malaria: ~143K

Typhoid: ~115K

Pneumonia: ~57K

Fracture: ~29K

This helps in disease-wise resource and staff planning.

5️⃣ Which doctors receive the highest feedback volume?

Doctors like Ravi D, Mark Joy, Jay Sinha, Jaya Yadav, Tejas Saxena, Niki Sharma, and Naresh Goyenka all receive almost equal feedback volume (~4.83K each).

This shows patient feedback is evenly distributed among doctors.

6️⃣ How does billing amount compare with insurance amount across medical tests?

CT Scan, Ultrasound, and MRI generate high billing and insurance amounts

Blood Test and X-Ray generate much lower revenue

Advanced diagnostic tests are the main revenue contributors.

7️⃣ Which diagnostic test generates the highest revenue?

CT Scan generates the highest billing (~₹57M)

Followed by Ultrasound (~₹58M) and MRI (~₹53M)

This highlights key profit-generating services.

8️⃣ What is the trend between insurance claims and billing amounts?

Billing amounts are slightly higher than insurance amounts across most services, indicating out-of-pocket patient payments.

9️⃣ What date range is used for the analysis?

The dashboard analyzes data from 12-Jan-2023 to 07-Mar-2024, giving a long-term operational view.

🔟 How does this dashboard help hospital management?

It helps management:

Monitor revenue and billing

Track bed utilization

Identify common diseases

Evaluate doctor performance

Focus on high-revenue medical services


## 📊 KPI LIST 

1️⃣ Total Billing Amount – ₹190.43M

2️⃣ Total Patients Treated – Diagnosis-wise patient count

3️⃣ Bed Occupancy Rate – Private, General, ICU

4️⃣ ICU Utilization – Lowest occupied critical care beds

5️⃣ Top Diagnosis by Patient Count – Viral Infection

6️⃣ Doctor Feedback Volume – Feedback per doctor

7️⃣ Revenue by Diagnostic Test – CT Scan, MRI, Ultrasound

8️⃣ Insurance vs Billing Amount – Coverage gap analysis

9️⃣ High Revenue Services – CT Scan & Ultrasound

🔟 Date-wise Treatment Coverage – Admit, discharge & follow-up tracking


## 🛠️ TOOLS USED

Power BI – Dashboard creation & data visualization

Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning & preprocessing

DAX – KPI calculations & measures

CSV / Hospital Data – Source dataset

 ## 📊 Key Insights Short
 
 Total hospital billing reached ₹190.43M
 Private beds have the highest occupancy; ICU beds are under-utilized
 Viral infections are the most common diagnosis
 CT Scan, MRI & Ultrasound are top revenue-generating tests
 Billing amount is higher than insurance coverage, indicating patient out-of-pocket cost
 Doctor feedback is evenly distributed, showing balanced workload
 Disease trends help plan staffing, beds, and medical supplies


.

## 💡Business Recommendations

✔ Focus more resources on Viral Infection and Flu cases as they have the highest patient count

✔ Improve ICU awareness and referral efficiency to increase ICU utilization

✔ Promote CT Scan, MRI, and Ultrasound services as they generate maximum revenue

✔ Review insurance coverage gaps to reduce patient out-of-pocket expenses

✔ Maintain balanced doctor workload since feedback is evenly distributed

✔ Plan staffing and medicines based on disease trends

✔ Optimize bed allocation to reduce overcrowding in private wards

## 🧠 Introduction

Healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries in the world — but making sense of that data isn’t always easy. With increasing patient loads, complex billing systems, and critical feedback loops, hospitals need clarity more than ever.

That’s why I built an interactive, Power BI-based dashboard using real-world hospital data from Papollo Healthcare. In this article, I’ll take you through my HealthCare Data Analysis & Visualization project that transforms spreadsheets into meaningful insights, helping administrators make smarter, faster decisions. 

## 🏥 Project Goal: From Data to Decisions

The core idea was simple — take raw hospital data and build a visual dashboard that provides:

✅ Operational insights

✅ Diagnosis and billing trends

✅ Bed and doctor performance metrics

✅ Patient feedback patterns


This project helps hospital administrators answer crucial questions like:


. Which diagnoses are most frequent?

. Are we overbilling or under-insured?

. Which departments or doctors are getting the most feedback?

. How are occupancy levels across ICU, General, and Private wards?


## 🧩 Key Insights from the Dashboard

🦠 Top Diagnoses: Viral infections and flu were the most commonly reported issues.

🧑‍⚕️ Feedback Trends: Dr. Jay Sinha and Dr. Ravi D received the highest patient feedback volumes.

💰 Billing vs. Insurance: Billing frequently exceeded insurance coverage, signaling financial inefficiencies.

🛏️ Bed Usage: General wards had the highest occupancy — an opportunity to optimize room allocation.



## 🔨 Tools Used

. Power BI — For data modeling, relationships, dynamic visualizations

. Excel — For data cleaning and preprocessing before import



## 🎯 Dashboard Features

. 🎚️ Interactive filters for patient ID and date range

. 📈 Dynamic charts showing diagnosis, billing, and feedback trends

. 🏥 Bed occupancy analysis by department (ICU, General, Private)

. 🧾 Financial view: Billing vs. insurance gaps



## 🖼️ Sample Visuals & KPIs

🟣 Pie Charts — Diagnosis categories

🔵 Bar Graphs — Feedback by doctor

🟢 Line Charts — Monthly billing and discharge trends

🟡 KPI Cards — Total billed, insured, feedback counts



## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download and open Hospital_Analysis.pbix in Power BI Desktop.

2. Place Papollo-Healthcare-Dataset.xlsx in the same folder.

3. Refresh the data model.

4. Use filters to explore insights across time, doctors, or departments.


## 📌 Why This Matters

This project isn’t just about pretty charts — it’s about solving real-world healthcare problems. Whether you’re a data analyst, hospital manager, or student learning Power BI, this dashboard shows how data can be used for actionable insight and operational improvement in healthcare.

It was also a hands-on way to improve my skills in:

. 🔄 Data integration & cleaning

. 📊 Visual storytelling

. 🧠 Healthcare KPI analysis
