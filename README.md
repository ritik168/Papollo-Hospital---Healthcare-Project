# Papollo-Hospital :- Healthcare-Project


## 🧠 Introduction

Healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries in the world — but making sense of that data isn’t always easy. With increasing patient loads, complex billing systems, and critical feedback loops, hospitals need clarity more than ever.

That’s why I built an interactive, Power BI-based dashboard using real-world hospital data from Papollo Healthcare. In this article, I’ll take you through my HealthCare Data Analysis & Visualization project that transforms spreadsheets into meaningful insights, helping administrators make smarter, faster decisions. 

## 🏥 Project Goal: From Data to Decisions

The core idea was simple — take raw hospital data and build a visual dashboard that provides:

✅ Operational insights
✅ Diagnosis and billing trends
✅ Bed and doctor performance metrics
✅ Patient feedback patterns

## This project helps hospital administrators answer crucial questions like:

Which diagnoses are most frequent?

Are we overbilling or under-insured?

Which departments or doctors are getting the most feedback?

How are occupancy levels across ICU, General, and Private wards?

🧩 Key Insights from the Dashboard
🦠 Top Diagnoses: Viral infections and flu were the most commonly reported issues.
🧑‍⚕️ Feedback Trends: Dr. Jay Sinha and Dr. Ravi D received the highest patient feedback volumes.
💰 Billing vs. Insurance: Billing frequently exceeded insurance coverage, signaling financial inefficiencies.
🛏️ Bed Usage: General wards had the highest occupancy — an opportunity to optimize room allocation.
